## Ascent of Money
Money is power.
Nobody knew this better than the kings of the ancient world. That’s why they gave themselves an absolute monopoly on minting moolah.
They turned shiny metal into coins, paid their soldiers and their soldiers bought things at local stores. The king then sent their soldiers to the merchants with a simple message:
“Pay your taxes in this coin or we’ll kill you.”

## Preamble
Banks are centralised institutions that, among other things, offer credit to individuals, groups and corporations. Historically, banks were a nexus of borrowers and lenders, matching the supply of liquidity to the demand for credit. The primary role of a bank was risk management in the form of the due diligence required to assess if a potential borrower was a worthwhile investment. With the advent of nation-state money printing and fractional-reserve banking, whereby money is lent into existence and losses are publicly subsidized by inflation and bailouts, the traditional care of risk management for loans has all but been obiliterated.
