## Inspiration
Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) is a method of debt financing that enables individuals to borrow and lend money - without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. Peer-to-peer lending removes the middleman from the process, but it also involves more time, effort and risk than the general brick-and-mortar lending scenarios.

## How do we reduce this risk factor and make the whole system more robust?

The biggest problem facing the unbanked across the globe is the lack of formal records that can be used to create traditional credit scores.
A simple solution is probably staring you in the face as you read: the mobile phone. The rapid spread of mobile phones mean that pretty soon most of the world will be making payments to their local telecom or cellphone service provider.

We deliver credit and marketing scores for emerging consumers using mobile phone data to solve the problem.
